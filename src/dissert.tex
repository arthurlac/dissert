\title{Algebraic Effects and Monads as Programming Techniques for Managing Effects}

\begin{document}
\section{Abstract}

KEY IDEAS:
Monads and Computation\\
Notions of Computation Determine Monads\\
Algebraic Effects\\
Purely Functional Data structures\\
Why Functional Programming Matters\\

Effects are tricky, and essential!
Programmers have long sought to make them more predictable;
this may come at the cost of complexity.

Two tools in dealing with effects, which both originate from category theory,
are monads and algebraic effects.

Most programmers are completely unaware of monads and algebraic effects.
Some are unconvinced.

This paper will attempt to introduce them and make case a for their use.

Elucidate the relation between monads and algebraic effects

their effectiveness as programming techniques.

AE and monads being state of the art????

I will present example code showing

Demonstrate monad-like programming techniques are already common in imperative languages

Explain where monad-like patterns arise in imperative programming and how monads are often a better alternative

THE KEY POINT IS MONADS ARE GREAT FOR STRUCTURING PROGRAMS TO BE understandable/reliable/correct

Finally I will present an abridged version which forgoes everything except the essentials
which presumes less familiarity with functional language conventions
with the goal of introducing and advocating for the concepts
the target audience being programmers
As such the success can be judged by how well it explains the use and benefits of both monads and algebraic effects.

Category theory as a framework for better software\\
as a generalisation of mathematics being a powerful tool to understand the world\\

\section{Conclusion}
it is fundementally unarguably more difficult to reason about code with side effects
monads and algebraic effects help make this easier
