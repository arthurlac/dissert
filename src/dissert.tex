\title{A comparison of algebraic effects and monads}

\begin{document}
\section{Abstract}

KEY IDEAS:
Monads and Computation\\
Notions of Computation Determine Monads\\
Algebraic Effects\\
Rewriting our examples\\
Purely Functional Data structures\\
Why Functional Programming Matters\\
Why functional Progamming matters\\
Conclusion: category theory times functional programming matters\\
Category theory as a framework for better software\\
mathematics in general as a powerful tool to understand the world\\


Effects are tricky, and essential!
Programmers have long sought to make them more predictable;
this may come at the cost of complexity.

Most programmers are unaware, or unconvinced, of monads and algebraic effects.
This paper will attempt to introduce them and make case a for their use.

Elucidate the relation between monads and algebraic effects
and their effectiveness as programming techniques.
I will present example code showing
Demonstrate monad-like programming techniques are already common in imperative languages
Explain where monad-like patterns arise in imperative programming and how monads are often a better alternative
THE KEY POINT IS MONADS ARE GREAT FOR STRUCTURING PROGRAMS TO BE understandable/reliable/correct

Finally I will present an abridged version which forgoes some theory and background
with the goal of introducing and advocating for the concepts
target audience being programmers
As such the success can be judged by how well it explains the use and benefits of both monads and algebraic effects.
