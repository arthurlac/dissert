\section{Abstract}
Effects are essential and unavoidable
but a major source of unpredictability
and complexity, and thus bugs.
This document will discuss two tools to manage effects,
both of which originate from category theory,
monads and algebraic effects.
Many programmers are completely unaware of monads and algebraic effects,
some are unconvinced.
This paper will attempt to introduce them,
elucidate their relation,
and advocate for their effectiveness as programming techniques.
Finally I will present an abridged version
which presumes less familiarity with functional language conventions
with the same goal as the rest of this document;
the target audience being programmers.
In essence this document is part of a larger
proposition for category theory as a framework for better software construction;
the generalisation being that mathematics is a powerful tool to understand the world.

\section{Conclusion}
It is fundamentally more difficult to reason about code with effects
than without, however forgoing effects is forgoing usefulness itself.
This document presents a clear case that monads and algebraic effects
can be useful tools for engineering programs to be correct, maintainable, and understandable.

This project was motivated by my desire to understand both monads and algebraic effects,
as theoretical concepts and as tools.
At first I found algebraic effects, in particular, unapproachable,
the content in even the simplest papers were beyond my knowledge at the time.
I wanted to understand how these seemingly very disparate
things could be so closely closely related,
that they can express so much with such simple pieces.
Not only that, I wanted to explore
their direct usefulness and application in
every-day programming,
how I could use them to build programs,
and moreover why they were in some cases the right choice
and why they might be the wrong choice.
I feel in that end I have made considerable progress,
and look forward to continuing that progress.
Ideally I have produced something which has the information
necessary to build intuitive notions of the techniques discussed.

Above all I have found myself very curious at the idea that concepts
from mathematics can correspond to constructing elegant programs.

When one considers, however,
that category theory has been called the study
of "abstract nonsense"\cite{mac1997pnas},
it is no great surprise it can be so useful in software engineering,
when a great deal of software engineering is deciding what one
can make abstract while maintaining necessary structural properties.

\textbf{Acknowledgements}\\
Firstly I would like to thank my supervisor
for his advice, support, and contagious enthusiasm for category theory.
I would also like to thank for his thoughtful feedback
and expertise on JavaScript and engineering.
