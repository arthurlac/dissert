\section{Abstract}
%TODO LISCNECES
%KEY IDEAS:
%Purely Functional Monad/AE Data structures\\
%Why Functional Programming Matters\\

Effects are essential and unavoidable
but a major source of unpredictability
and complexity, and thus bugs.
%Programmers have long sought to make them more predictable,
%this may come at the cost of complexity and flexibility.
This document will discus two tools to manage effects,
both of which originate from category theory,
monads and algebraic effects.
Many programmers are completely unaware of monads and algebraic effects,
some are unconvinced.
This paper will attempt to introduce them,
elucidate their relation,
and advocate for their effectiveness as programming techniques.
Finally I will present an abridged version
which presumes less familiarity with functional language conventions
with the same goal as the rest of this document;
the target audience being programmers.
In essence this document is part of a larger
proposition for category theory as a framework for better software construction;
the generalisation being that mathematics is a powerful tool to understand the world.

\section{Conclusion}
it is fundementally unarguably more difficult to reason about code with side effects
monads and algebraic effects help make this easier
to help AE have some of the use of bind

This project was motivated by my desire to understand both monads and algebraic effects.
At first I found algebraic effects
unapproachable,
the academic background
in even the simplest tutorials
was above my own at the time.
Ideally I have produced
something which has the intuitive notions
I have found myself very curious at the idea that an idea from
mathematics can correspond to constructing elegant programs,
the relation of these concepts
to effects,
their direct usefulness in
every-day programming

I hope I have elucidated
both the theoretical background
and how these concepts translates to
useful tools for engineering.


Hopefully I have desrcibed some ofthe considerations
one must take when using
monads and algebraic
in engineering large programs.
